Tiles takes inspiration from many different concepts within the realm of music production and electro-acoustic composition techniques.
Tiles is primarily catered towards music production, but it is not bound to a musical context, so you could use Tiles for whatever you want.

Some common use cases for Tiles:
*Update - 2024-04-07 - Example use cases will be added as separate branches to this repository on 1.2.0 release.
- "MPC"-style grid for finger drumming.
- Interactive sequencer in any shape or form. 
- Canvas for drawing with multiple fingers.
- Slider(s).
